I used to play the bass in a band. Listening to our songs feels like reminiscing ~~on~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Use 'about' with 'reminisce' in US English.">about</span> the golden times when I was a musician in Moscow.

There is a particular song that is called "~~Millenial~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Spelling: 'millennial' has two n’s.">Millennial</span>"<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma to set off a nonessential clause.">,</span> which is our most powerful song ~~for the gigs~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Use 'at' for events and drop 'the' for general statements.">at gigs</span>. This song has a very powerful hook that we scream with the ~~crowds~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Singular 'crowd' is more natural in this context.">crowd</span><span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma to introduce a quoted line.">,</span> "Тебе кто это сказал, точно какой-то конченный миллениал<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma before a nonessential 'which'; in US style, commas go inside closing quotes.">,</span>" which translates to "Who told you that? Must have been some ~~messed up~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Hyphenate a compound adjective before a noun.">messed-up</span> millennial<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Periods go inside closing quotation marks in US English.">.</span>"

Usually we conclude our set with it. When a crowd is pumped up and ~~hear~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Singular subject 'crowd' takes 'hears.'">hears</span> this song<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma after a dependent clause that comes before the main clause.">,</span> they get even more amped up and they dance like crazy.

Every time I hear this song<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma after an introductory clause.">,</span> it reminds me of our concerts, after-parties, ~~rehears~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Complete word needed: 'rehearsals.'">rehearsals</span>, post-rehearsal beers<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Oxford comma for list clarity.">,</span> and <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Add a possessive determiner for natural phrasing.">our</span> band community. I was in a band for almost ~~5~~ <span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Spell out numbers under ten in formal writing.">five</span> years<span style="color:red" class="tutor-corr" data-note="Comma before a coordinating conjunction joining two independent clauses.">,</span> and my whole student life was shaped by it. I miss it a lot.
