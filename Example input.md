I used to play the bass in a band. Listening to our songs feels like reminiscing on the golden times when I was a musician in Moscow. 

There is a particular song that is called "Millennial" which is our most powerful song at gigs. This song has a very powerful hook that we scream with the crowd, "Тебе кто это сказал, точно какой-то конченный миллениал" which translates to "Who told you that? Must have been some messed-up millennial"  

Usually we conclude our set with it. When a crowd is pumped up and hears this song they get even more amped up and they dance like crazy.

Every time I hear this song it reminds me of our concerts, after-parties, rehearsals, post-rehearsal beers and band community. I was in a band for almost five years, and my whole student life was shaped by it. I miss it a lot.
